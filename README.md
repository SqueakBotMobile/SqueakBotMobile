## About SqueakBotMobile:
This is a mobile app using React Native that helps the user practice white boarding questions. 
SqueakBotMobile is a helpful mock interviewer for a software developer to practice common whiteboard questions in 
preparation for job interviews in the tech industry. It uses AI technology to listen to a users request and outputs a 
question. When a user asks, "Give me a challenge", the google API will receive your request through the microphone on a 
mobile device. Using a Node Server, it pulls a random question from a SQL database and reads it out loud.
